## Motivation
Developing an Android app from scratch often involves considerable time and effort just to set up the basic structure, including a launch screen, navigation menu, and essential core components. This project was created to streamline that initial setup process, providing a robust starter template that includes all the necessary foundational elements. By using this template, developers can skip the repetitive setup tasks and focus immediately on building and enhancing app functionality.

UPDATE: This project was started in 2017. Android development has moved on, not only is the design language used in this template dated but i'm sure modern IDEs come with starter templates now.
